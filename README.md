# Neural Net for Sentence Classification
Introduction and Architecture details:
Sentence classifier presented for this assignment is based on below papers:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification by Yoon Kim
2. MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottleneck by Mark Sandler et. al.
Although MobileNetV2 is for image classification, I wanted to try out the same architecture to classify sentences.
